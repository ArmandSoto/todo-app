When trying to implement completedTasks as a state and change the CompletedTasks page to Important
we ran across the following issues:

1. Everything is based off of id and order which is determined inside of setter functions based off of index
like in handleDeleteTask and drop. If this is not fixed, this could lead to potential conflicts in Id when switching between completed tasks and and the items list in our program.

Update-- found a work around and am currently making sure to correctly insert elements when moving between completed and items in local storage


*Major bug -- you have to separate the important tasks to have its own state

Another issue is to make sure there are no duplicateswhen marking something as important and adding to the important list

editing in one part of the progaam does not change it in both tabs

Deal with scrollable when the number of tasks grows too large

Check the logic for marking something as unimportant an item it creates a duplicate in the other part of the application
